# restoration

A CLI for restoring [Age of Mythology: Retold](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aom/age-of-mythology-retold/) .mythrec files into human readable formats, such as JSON. This is a replay parser.

## Background

This package was written so that the AoM community could have an easy to use, well-maintained tool for parsing rec files. It is also made so that [aomstats.io](https://aomstats.io) can use it to parse rec files and extract even more stats (e.g., minor god choices and build orders).

Heavily inspired by [loggy's work](https://github.com/erin-fitzpatric/next-aom-gg/blob/main/src/server/recParser/recParser.ts) for aom.gg and his [proof of concept python parser](https://github.com/Logg-y/retoldrecprocessor/blob/main/recprocessor.py). I am unabashedly using his work as a reference to build this package. Some portions may be direct copies.
